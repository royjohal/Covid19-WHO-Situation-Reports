## Coronavirus disease

### Situation Report – 33

########### Data as reported by 10AM CET 22 February 2020*

##### HIGHLIGHTS

# 2019 (COVID-19)

- Two new countries (Lebanon and Israel) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is not yet clear. On 18 February, a new protocol entitled [“Surface sampling of  
coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical “how to” protocol for health  
care and public health professionals”](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations) was published. This protocol was designed to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in various locations where a COVID-19 patient is receiving care or isolated, and to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus.

- The WHO Director-General briefed the emergency ministerial meeting on COVID-19 organized by the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Details can be found [here.](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/emergency-ministerial-meeting-on-covid-19-organized-by-the-african-union-and-the-africa-centres-for-disease-control-and-prevention)

**SUBJECT IN FOCUS: New protocol for Early Epidemiologic and Clinical Investigations for Public Health Response**

The **understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features and risk factors for COVID-19 is currently limited** among the general population, among health care workers, in households and in other “closed” settings.

On 18 February, a new master protocol entitled **[“Surface sampling of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A practical  
“how to” protocol for health care and public health professionals”](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations ** was published.

The role of environmental contamination in the transmission of COVID-19 is not yet clear. This protocol was designed to determine viable virus presence and persistence on fomites in various locations where a COVID-19 patient is receiving care or isolated, and to understand how fomites may play a role in the transmission of the virus in these settings. It is important that surface sampling is done as part of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, and that information obtained by  
investigations.

environmental studies is combined with findings from epidemiological and laboratory

As a reminder, several early investigation **master protocols** and **master forms** for COVID-19 are available: **Early Epidemiologic and Clinical Investigations**

######## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

W HO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

- WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
- WHO has developed interim guidance for [laboratory diagnosis,](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance) [advice on the use of masks during home care and

- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread,

severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations)

- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, clinical management and mathematical modelling.

##### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

D uring previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:

- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
- Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
- People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
- Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider.
