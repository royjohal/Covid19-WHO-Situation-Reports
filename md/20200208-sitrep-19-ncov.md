#### TECHNICAL FOCUS: Infection prevention and control

From the beginning of this outbreak, WHO has convened several global expert networks for laboratory, clinical management, mathematical modelling, risk communication and community engagement, and infection prevention and control (IPC). The IPC global network is convened through weekly teleconferences with international IPC experts to discuss technical aspects of IPC measures, share epidemiological updates and experiences regarding the IPC measures put in place in affected countries. International participants are members of the Global Infection Prevention and Control Network (GIPCN) or members of relevant institutions caring for infected 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients.

In consultation with the global IPC expert network, WHO has released three key IPC interim guidance materials. These materials are available here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-  
guidance](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance)

The first document - *[Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  
infection is suspected. Interim guidance v2](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus- ncov -infection-is-suspected-20200125 * - defines the following five IPC strategies to prevent or limit human to human transmission in health care settings:

1. Ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection);
2. Applying standard precautions for all patients;
3. Implementing empiric additional precautions (droplet and contact and, whenever applicable, airborne precautions) for suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection;
4. Implementing administrative controls;
5. Using environmental and engineering controls.

The second document - *[Home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection presenting  
with mild symptoms and management of contacts. Guidance- v2](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/home-care-for-patients-with-suspected-novel-coronavirus- ncov -infection-presenting-with-mild-symptoms-and-management-of-contacts * – provides recommendations in the context of home care for mild patients. Guidance is provided (i) for a household/caregiver’s protection including which personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when caring for someone infected with 2019-nCoV and on environmental and waste management; (ii) for an infected individual with mild disease, for example to wear a mask; and (iii) for the management of contacts (including caregivers/health care workers) which includes 14 days of monitoring of health for contacts.

The third document - *[Advice on the use of masks in the community, during home care and in health care settings in  
the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Interim guidance – v1.](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov -outbreak * In community settings, medical masks are not recommended for people without symptoms. For those who choose to wear medical masks, appropriate mask management should be followed, which includes how to use and dispose of masks. Symptomatic individuals are recommended to wear medical masks and seek early medical care if there are any signs of respiratory distress.

###### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

### PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE

- WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The guidance can be found on the [IATA webpage.](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/safety/health/diseases/#tab-2)
- WHO has developed a protocol for the investigation of early cases (the [“First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact  
investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”).](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x- ffx -cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov -infection) The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 2019- nCoV infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection.
- WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
- WHO has developed interim guidance for [laboratory diagnosis,](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/laboratory-diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus) [advice on the use of masks during home care and

- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 2019-nCoV, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of

countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations)

- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, clinical management and mathematical modelling.

### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:

- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
- Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
- People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
- Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider.
