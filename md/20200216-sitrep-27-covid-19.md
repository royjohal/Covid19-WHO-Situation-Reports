### Situation Report – 27

########## Data as reported by 16 February 2020*

#### HIGHLIGHTS

# 2019 (COVID-19)

- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- A third death of a COVID-19 patient has been reported outside of China. This individual was a tourist from China visiting France.

- Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different settings are therefore critical to furthering our understanding of this virus and associated disease. Several early investigation **master protocols or master forms** are available for countries to use. More information can be found [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations)

##### TECHNICAL FOCUS: Early Epidemiologic and Clinical investigations

The recent emergence of COVID-19 means that understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features and risk factors for infection remains limited, whether about the general population, health workers or in household and other “closed” settings. Studies to assess the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cases in different settings are therefore critical to furthering our understanding of this virus and associated disease. They will also provide the robust information needed to feed forecasting models.

S everal early investigation **master protocols or master forms** are available for countries:

1. **FFX (First Few X number of cases and their close contacts) transmission protocol:** case and close contact tracing in the general population. Contact: [earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int](mailto:earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int)

FFX is the primary investigation protocol to be initiated upon identification of the initial laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a country.

For a more targeted approach on specific groups and more precise estimation of epidemiological parameters, three other investigation protocols are available:

2. **Household (HH) transmission study protocol.** Contact: [earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int](mailto:earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int)

3. **Risk factors assessment for Health Workers (HCW) protocol.** Contact: [earlyinvestigations-2019-  
nCoV@who.int](mailto:earlyinvestigations-2019-nCoV@who.int)

4. **Environmental sampling protocol** (in development)

5. [**Global COVID-19 Clinical Characterization Case Record Form](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-ncov-crf.pdf?sfvrsn=84766e69_2) :** a standard approach to collect clinical data of hospitalized patients is necessary to better understand clinical characteristics of the disease and treatment interventions. Anonymized clinical data and information related to patients with suspected or confirmed infections can be shared. Contact: [EDCARN@who.int](mailto:EDCARN@who.int) for log-in details.

*To support country implementation of the first two protocols (FFX, HH), it is recommended to use the Go.Data field electronic tool for case and contacts data collection and management. The FFX and HH protocol questionnaire templates are available in Go.Data. Visit [www.who.int/godata](file:///C:/Users/dwyert/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/6C7A0L80/www.who.int/godata) or contact [godata@who.int](mailto:godata@who.int) for more information.*

These protocols and forms have been designed so that data can be rapidly and systematically collected and shared in a format that facilitates aggregation, tabulation and analysis across different settings globally. We encourage any and all countries and study centres to contribute to this effort regardless of resource availability or patient volume. The ownership of the primary data remains firmly with the individual countries/sites.

D ata collected using these investigation protocols will be critical to refine recommendations for case definitions and surveillance, characterize key epidemiological features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, and impact on the community and to inform guidance for application of countermeasures such as case isolation and contact tracing.

####### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

W HO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

Several protocols are available here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations)

- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, clinical management and mathematical modelling.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

D uring previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:

- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
- Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
- People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
- Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider.
