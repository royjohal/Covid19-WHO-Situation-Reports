##### SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Update on partner coordination with international travel, transport and tourism sectors

As the on-going Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to develop, WHO is committed to working together with the travel, transport and tourism sectors on emergency preparedness and response.

In a global world with hyperconnected international travel and transport, points of entry (PoEs)– airports, ports and ground crossings – can play a key role in the international spread of diseases through travellers, conveyances and goods. The travel and transport sectors are indispensable actors in public health emergency preparedness and response actions related to PoEs.

WHO has published three joint statements to remind all stakeholders of the importance of following International Health Regulations and guidance, existing regulations of partner organizations, and the need for cross-sector collaboration. The joint statements were released respectively, with the [International Maritime Organization](http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Documents/Circular%20Letter%20No.4204-Add.2%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20Imo-Who%20On%20The%20Response%20To%20The%20Covid-19%20Outbreak%20 Secretariat .pdf) (IMO), the [International Civil Aviation Organization](https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/Pages/Statements.aspx) (ICAO) and the [World Tourism Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2020-a-joint-statement-on-tourism-and-covid-19---unwto-and-who-call-for-responsibility-and-coordination) (UNWTO).

With input from IMO, ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and UNWTO as well as major industry associations, WHO has produced and continues to develop comprehensive COVID-19 technical guidance on maritime and aviation traffic and ground crossings. These include:

- [Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on board ships (Interim guidance);](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/operational-considerations-for-managing-covid-19-cases-outbreak-on-board-ships)
- [Management of ill travellers at Points of Entry – international airports, seaports and ground crossings – in  
the context of COVID-19 outbreak;](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/management-of-ill-travellers-at-points-of-entry-international-airports-seaports-and-ground-crossings-in-the-context-of-covid--19-outbreak)
- [Public health preparedness and response for aviation sector;](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/handbook-for-the-management-of-public-health-events-in-air-transport-updated-with-information-on-ebola-virus-disease-and-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus)
- [Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board ships;](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/operational-considerations-for-managing-covid-19-cases-outbreak-on-board-ships) and the
- [Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships.](https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/9789241549462/en/)

Additionally, guidance on operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreak in aviation, scaling up preparedness for COVID-19 at ground crossings, and managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in hotels and other travel and tourism accommodations are under development and will be available soon.

WHO also regularly updates travel advice to support emergency preparedness, which is available [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice) ICAO is also publishing a [dedicated website with specific resources,](https://www.icao.int/Security/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx) and guidance for airlines industries and national authorities. Similarly, [IMO](http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx) and [UNWTO](https://www.unwto.org/tourism-covid-19-coronavirus) host dedicated websites with resources and guidance for their members and stakeholders.

†The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. ‡Case classifications are based on [WHO case definitions](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov) for COVID-19.  
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  
Terms:

- **Community transmission** is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).
- **Local transmission** indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- **Imported cases only** indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- **Under investigation** indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- **Interrupted transmission** indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)  
\*\* “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  
††Including 13 (5 new) cases from Kosovo[1]  
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).

Due to a retrospective data consolidation exercise, some numbers may not reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.

Erratum: The total number of cases and new cases for Sudan have been corrected.

###### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations) One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the [“First Few X (FFX) Cases and  
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”).](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x- ffx -cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov -infection) The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your

risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see [Frequently Asked Questions).](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see [Protection measures for everyone).](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See [Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

#### CASE DEFINITIONS

WHO periodically updates the [Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov) document which includes case definitions.

For easy reference, case definitions are included below.

####### Suspect case

A. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See [situation  
report)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  
**OR**  
B. A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID- 19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;  
**OR**  
C. A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation.

####### Probable case

A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.  
Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory •

####### Confirmed case

A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance) •
