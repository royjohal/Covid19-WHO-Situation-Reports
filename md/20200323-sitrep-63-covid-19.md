- The number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 300,000 globally.

- Data reported are based on information received from national authorities by 10:00 AM CET, 23 March 2020.

- Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is critical to tracking the virus, understanding epidemiology, informing case management, and to suppressing transmission. WHO has updated the [Laboratory Testing Strategy document](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf) according to the 4Cs transmission scenarios. All technical guidance can be found [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance)

- WHO Regional Office for Europe has published interim guidance on how to deal with COVID-19 in prisons and other places of detention, available [here.](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/prisons-and-health/news/news/2020/3/preventing-covid-19-outbreak-in-prisons-a-challenging-but-essential-task-for-authorities)

- World Water Day 2020, celebrated on 22 March, highlighted the essential role of hand washing in hygiene to protect you and those around you. WHO Regional Office for Europe provides more information [here.](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/water-and-sanitation/news/news/2020/3/world-water-day-2020-highlights-the-essential-role-of-handwashing)

†The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement. ‡Case classifications are based on [WHO case definitions](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov) for COVID-19.  
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  
Terms:

- **Community transmission** is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).
- **Local transmission** indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- **Imported cases only** indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- **Under investigation** indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- **Interrupted transmission** indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)  
\*\* “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  
^ Data for the European Region is obtained from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)  
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).

Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different data cutoff times are to be expected.

New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.

Erratum: Transmission classification has been revised for Jordan and total deaths have been revised for Croatia.

##### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

- WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
- OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. [COVID-19 courses can be found here.](https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19) Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese, Serbian, and Turkish); Clinical Care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, and Vietnamese); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian, and Portuguese); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations) One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the [“First Few X (FFX) Cases and  
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”).](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x- ffx -cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov -infection) The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see [Frequently Asked Questions).](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see [Protection measures for everyone).](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See [Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past  
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

#### CASE DEFINITIONS

WHO periodically updates the [Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov) document which includes case definitions.

For easy reference, case definitions are included below.

###### Suspect case

A. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.  
**OR**  
B. A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  
**OR**  
C. A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation.

###### Probable case

A. A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive.  
a. Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory. **OR**  
B. A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.

###### Confirmed case

A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

- Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found [here.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance)

###### Definition of contact

A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days

---

after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:

1. Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes;
2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
3. Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment1; OR
4. Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments.

Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days *after the date on which the sample was taken* which led to confirmation.
