## ZIKA VIRUS

# Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

### SITUATION REPORT - 3

####### Data as reported by: 23 January 20201

#### SUMMARY

######### Situation update:

### 23 JANUARY 2020

- A total of 581 confirmed cases have been reported for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) globally;
- Of the 581 cases reported, 571 cases were reported from China;
- Cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Taipei Municipality, China, Macau Special Administrative Region, United States of America and the Republic of Korea; All had travel history to Wuhan;
- Of the 571 confirmed cases in China, 375 cases were confirmed from Hubei Province;
- Of the 571 cases, 95 cases are severely ill2 ;
- Seventeen deaths have been reported (all from Hubei Province);

On 23 January2020, the number of reported confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV has increased by 267 cases since the last situation report published on 22 January 2020. As of 23 January, China reported cases in 25 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). Twenty five percent of confirmed cases reported by China have been classified by Chinese health authorities as seriously ill (from Wubei Province: (16% severely ill, 5% critically ill, and 4% having died).

Currently, cases infected in China have been exported to the US, Thailand, Japan and Republic of Korea. It is expected that more cases will be exported to other countries, and that further transmission may occur.

The initial source of 2019-nCoV still remains unknown. However, it is clear the growing outbreak is no longer due to ongoing exposures at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan; as in the last one week, less than 15% of new cases reported having visited Huanan market. There is now more evidence that 2019-nCoV spreads from human- to- human and also across generations of  
cases. Moreover, family clusters involving persons with no reported travel to Wuhan have been

reported from Guangdong Province. There have been very few reports of hospital outbreaks or infections of health care workers, which is a prominent feature of MERS and SARS.

WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.3

##### United States of America:

- On 7 January 2020, the US CDC established a 2019-nCoV Incident Management Structure. On 21 January 2020, US CDC activated its Emergency Response System to better provide ongoing support to the 2019-nCoV response. On 21 January 2020, US CDC again updated its interim travel health notice for persons traveling to Wuhan city, China. The travel notice was raised from Level 1; Practice Usual Precautions, to a Level 2: Practice Enhanced Precautions advising travellers that preliminary information suggests that older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease.
- CDC began entry screening of passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan China to the 3 main ports of entry in the United States on 17 January 2020 and will expand the screening to Atlanta and Chicago in the coming days.
- CDC issued an updated interim Health Alert Notice (HAN) Advisory to inform state and local health departments and health care providers about this outbreak on 17 January 2020.
- A CDC team has deployed a team to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington in response to the first reported case of 2019-nCoV in the United States, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill.
- CDC has developed a rRT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV.

##### IV. Statistical Modelling

WHO is working with a number of mathematical model groups to better understand the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of this event.

- Phylogenetic analysis suggests based on 23 full genome sequences submitted to GISAID, that the sequences exhibit little genetic variation, which is indicative of a recent origin of the sampled and sequenced viruses. The sequenced genomes show no evidence of additional introductions of the virus from a non-human animal reservoir, although the numbers of sequences are limited at present. (Andrew Rambaut, University of Edinburgh, UK)
- Updated estimated number of cases in Wuhan based on baseline assumptions and alternative scenarios: a total of 4000 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range: 1,000 – 9,700) had onset of symptoms by 18th January 2020 (Imai et al, [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-  
coronavirus/)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)
- The median size of the Wuhan outbreak is estimated to be 4, 050 infections (95% CI: 1.700- 7, 950) by using an estimate of 10 days from exposure to detection and an effective population of 20 million people in Wuhan catchment as of January 20 (Matteo Chinazzi et al [https://www.mobs-  
lab.org/uploads/6/7/8/7/6787877/wuhan_novel_coronavirus_jan21.pdf)](https://www.mobs-lab.org/uploads/6/7/8/7/6787877/wuhan_novel_coronavirus_jan21.pdf)
