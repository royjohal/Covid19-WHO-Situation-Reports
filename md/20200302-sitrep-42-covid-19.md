- A team of WHO experts has arrived in Tehran, Iran to support the COVID-19 response. The objectives are to identify transmission dynamics and at-risk populations, and provide technical guidance. Further information can be found [here.](http://www.emro.who.int/irn/iran-news/who-team-arrives-in-tehran-to-support-the-covid-19-response.html)

- Containment remains the top priority for all countries. Management for COVID-19 globally, however, is not a one-size-fits-all approach and must be tailored to the transmission scenario a country faces. Early robust measures are key to saving lives and halting transmission, notes the WHO Director- General. More information can be found [here.](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---2-march-2020)

- WHO’s Operations Supply and Logistics team are working across numerous areas to support the COVID-19 response. Activities include working to establish a Supply Chain Coordination Cell and providing a technical briefing for G20 members on the personal protective equipment (PPE) market situation. More information can be found in the Subject in Focus.

#### SUBJECT IN FOCUS: UPDATE ON OPERATIONS SUPPLY AND LOGISTICS

The WHO Operations Supply and Logistics (OSL) team continues to work across numerous areas to support emergency operations within a tightening market for supplies essential for the COVID-19 response.

Recent OSL activities are as follows:

- Together with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, WHO is working on a proposal to establish a Supply Chain Coordination Cell. This interagency team will help improve information management and coordination to support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.

- WHO has contacted the Global Health Security Initiative to address access to strategic national stockpiles. WHO is also engaging with the Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the World Bank and UNICEF, both as part of the Supply Chain Coordination Cell and to establish bridge financing mechanisms, data access and analysis to support planning, forecasting and market access.

- Weekly meetings of the Pandemic Supply Chain Partnership Network (PSCN) continue, along with bilateral discussions with manufacturers and distributors to advocate for the release and prioritization of supplies for the health care response. A technical briefing on the personal protective equipment (PPE) market situation is planned for G20 members next week, and PSCN members will engage with WFP to develop infection prevention and control (IPC) technical guidance on cargo handling.

- In cooperation with the International Humanitarian City in Dubai and with aircraft provided by the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), WHO has organized a flight from Dubai to Iran to support the first delivery of emergency PPE and laboratory tests.

- Since February 14, WHO has shipped PPE to more than 47 countries, and there are currently 22 additional countries to which PPE shipments are ready to be made. WHO has also shipped laboratory testing equipment to 93 countries.

\*Case classifications are based on [WHO case definitions](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov) for COVID-19.  
†Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.  
Terms:

- **Community transmission** is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- **Local transmission** indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- **Imported cases only** indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- **Under investigation** indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- **Interrupted transmission** indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)

####### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO has prepared a [disease commodity package](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus- ncov) that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
- WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of [transmission from animals to humans.](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets)

- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations) One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the [“First Few X (FFX) Cases and  
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”).](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x- ffx -cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus- 2019-ncov -infection) The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See [Frequently Asked Questions).](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).

If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).
