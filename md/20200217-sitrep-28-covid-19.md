### Situation Report – 28

########## Data as reported by 17 February 2020*

#### HIGHLIGHTS

# 2019 (COVID-19)

- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- From today, WHO will be reporting all confirmed cases, including both laboratory-confirmed as previously reported, and those reported as clinically diagnosed (currently only applicable to Hubei province, China). From 13 February through 16 February, we reported only laboratory confirmed cases for Hubei province as mentioned in the [situation report published on 13  
February.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200213-sitrep-24-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=9a7406a4_4) The change in reporting is now shown in the figures. This accounts for the apparent large increase in cases compared to prior situation reports.

- Based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19, WHO has developed guidance documents for managing public health events at Points of Entry and mass gatherings. These are posted on [WHO COVID-19 Points of  
Entry and Mass Gatherings](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings) website. See Technical Focus for more details.

- WHO Eastern Mediterranean office has updated information on COVID-19 cases. For more information please see [here.](http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/update-on-covid-19-in-the-eastern-mediterranean-region.html)

##### TECHNICAL FOCUS: Points of Entry (PoE) and mass gatherings:

A Point of Entry (PoE) encompasses ports, airports, ground crossings and means of passage for international entry or exit of travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcels as well as agencies and areas providing services to them on entry or exit (International Health Regulations 2005).

Based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19, WHO has developed guidance documents for managing public health events at PoE and mass gatherings. These are posted on [WHO COVID-19 Points of Entry and Mass  
Gatherings](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings) website.

The materials currently available are:

- Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this document will be to outline key planning considerations for organizers of mass gatherings in the context of COVID-19 outbreak, to be read in conjunction with WHO’s Public Health for Mass Gatherings: Key Considerations.
- Management of ill travellers at Points of Entry in the context of COVID-19 outbreak. This document provides advice on the detection and the management of ill travellers at international ports, airports and ground crossings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak It includes the following measures and should be implemented based on priorities and capacities of each country:
- Detection of ill travellers;
- Interview of ill travellers for COVID-19;
- Reporting of alerts of ill travellers with suspected COVID-19 infection;
- Isolation, initial case management and referral of ill travellers with suspected COVID-19 infection.

- Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships: This is a generic guidance addressing all public health risks and related maritime rules and regulations to assist States Parties in contingency planning and implementation of health measures onboard ships and at ports.
- Handbook for the Management of Public Health Events in Air Transport: This handbook was developed in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization. It is intended to help competent authorities at airports to implement a risk-based approach to public health events in a consistent manner and assist in determining interventions that are commensurate to the risks.
- An online course for public health preparedness for mass gathering events to support host nations in delivering a safe event.

The material that is in production includes operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board cruise ships. This material has been prepared based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19 transmission, by providing operational considerations for public health measures to manage cases, contacts and environment. It is recommended to be used in conjunction with the *Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships.*

####### STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to:

- Limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread from China\*;
- Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.

\*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication.

- WHO has activated of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
- WHO has developed an [online course](https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov) to provide general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses.
- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of

countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations)

- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO is working with global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, clinical management and mathematical modelling.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC

During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the COVID-19 can be similar. The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:

- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
- Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.
- People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
- Within health care facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider.
